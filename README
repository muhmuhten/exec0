exec0 - run a program with all arguments explicitly specified
=============================================================

Usage
-----

	exec0 prog argv...

Note that `argv[0]` "should point to a filename string that is associated with
the process being started"; this utility may be useful to test programs whose
behaviour depends on the name they're called by.

Additionally, it can be used to run a program with no arguments at all, which
on many systems cannot be achieved at all using standard utilities. Note that
programs are likely to misbehave when called this way.

Caveats
-------

This program uses the BSD error functions gratuitously. It would take longer to
justify than to replace them, but they're pretty widely available anyway.
